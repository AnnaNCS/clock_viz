Data Visualization Class Entry Project in JavaScript, Fall 2023: Abstract Clock Visualization

This project aimed to follow the p5.js reference pages on hours, minutes, and seconds to get the current time number.
Then use that number, via a mapping, to rotate, scale, translate, or change the color of your elements. The clock is hosted on the internet.

In order to visualize the code you could use the following editor:
https://editor.p5js.org/

To host the code online, clone the repository and open the index.html file.
